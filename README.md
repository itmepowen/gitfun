Linux intro

Everthing is a file in linux (including hardwares)

Most used Linux distros currently in IT industry.
1. RPM based
2. Debian based

RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) and Debian are two different package management systems used by various Linux distributions. The choice between RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions often depends on personal preference, specific needs, and the requirements of the system you are working on. Here are some key differences between RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions:

1. Package Management:

RPM-Based (e.g., Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora): Uses RPM package manager. Package files have a ".rpm" extension.
Debian-Based (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu): Uses APT (Advanced Package Tool) package manager. Package files have a ".deb" extension.

2. Package Format:

RPM-Based: RPM packages.
Debian-Based: DEB packages.

3. Package Tools:

RPM-Based: Uses tools like rpm, yum, and dnf for package management.
Debian-Based: Uses tools like dpkg, apt-get, and apt.

4. Package Repositories:

RPM-Based: Typically uses repositories provided by Red Hat or community repositories like EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux).
Debian-Based: Relies on Debian repositories or other repositories managed by Ubuntu and related distributions.

5. Configuration Files:

RPM-Based: Configuration files are often located in the /etc directory.
Debian-Based: Configuration files are also typically found in the /etc directory.

6. Release Cycle:

RPM-Based: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS have a more conservative release cycle, focusing on stability and long-term support.
Debian-Based: Debian stable releases are known for stability, while Ubuntu has regular releases with both LTS (Long Term Support) and non-LTS versions.

7. Init System:

RPM-Based: Traditionally used SysV init, but many distributions are transitioning to systemd.
Debian-Based: Uses systemd as the default init system.

8. Package Dependencies:

RPM-Based: Dependency resolution is handled by tools like yum and dnf.
Debian-Based: APT also handles dependency resolution.

9. Common Distributions:

RPM-Based: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Fedora.
Debian-Based: Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint.


In practice, both RPM-based and Debian-based systems are capable of running similar software and performing similar tasks. The choice between them often comes down to personal preference, familiarity, or specific requirements of the software you need to run. It's worth noting that many concepts and commands are similar between the two, and knowledge gained in one system is often transferable to the other.
